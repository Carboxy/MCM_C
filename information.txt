Amazon Vine invites the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about 
new and pre-release items to help their fellow customers make informed purchase 
decisions. Amazon invites customers to become Vine Voices based on their reviewer 
rank, which is a reflection of the quality and helpfulness of their reviews as 
judged by other Amazon customers. Amazon provides Vine members with free products 
that have been submitted to the program by participating vendors. Vine reviews 
are the independent opinions of the Vine Voices. The vendor cannot influence, 
modify or edit the reviews. Amazon does not modify or edit Vine reviews, as long 
as they comply with our posting guidelines. A Vine review is identified with the 
green stripe Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program.
