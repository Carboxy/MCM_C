29230018,US,Baby,B004GY8A58,343148814,the first years gumdrop newborn pacifier,"Let's talk about the form of the GumDrop nipple itself. I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise/air swallowing/gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex.<br /><br />Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures).<br /><br />After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now.<br /><br />I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon. As you'll see in the photos, the hospital paci has a &#34;matte&#34; finish (which probably feels rougher, more like a human nipple) and the First Years is shiny and smooth.<br /><br />*photo (left to right) orange newborn GumDrop, green 3+ months First Years GumDrop, blue Nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding.

25596556,US,Baby,B00EHKHVKG,925732558,wubbanub infant pacifier - owl,"If you're reading this review, you probably already know that Wubbanubs are awesome pacifiers. We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright/neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them! We use ours primarily in the car, but sometime around the house too. We just use a regular Avent pacifier for overnight, though, as stuffed animals are not safe to let them sleep with overnight (especially when very young).",3/8/2015,The best Wubbanub out there!,R2W6F3GK196ZQ2,N,5,13,12,N

Like food, clothes, and cars, binkies (aka pacifiers) are a very personal item for a baby.  I know some parents buy a binky only to have their little one spit it out at them.  They then buy another one and the baby loves it!<br /><br />These particular binkies aren't heavy and are geared toward newborns and up.  They're pretty small for little mouths so sucking shouldn't be an issue.  Parents can hold the pinkie in to help the baby get used to it.<br /><br />Fortunately, they're BPA-free and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Personally, I would rather wash it by hand like I did with bottles.<br /><br />Will your baby like these?  It's hard to tell.  Babies are very picky about their binkies.  The only thing you can do is buy the set and try them out.  Amazon doesn't charge too much so testing them out won't break you.  Hopefully your baby will like them and, if he/she does, get more of them!<br /><br />Did I mention the colors?

We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.",8/15/2014,"Great Pacifier, Cute Toy",R2BK466K2R9P7B,Y,5,11,10,N

I don't think most people understand difference between these and something from 99 cent store. The fact is that babies feel comfortable when eating or breast feeding and using a pacifier replicates that warmth and comfort. They cant move on their own or use toys so this provides comfort and entertainment. but the bigger issue is sucking creates pressure that can damage structure of babies mouth causing crocked teeth or cross bites. So these are worth the money and that is why after a certain age you have to stop toddler from pacifier habit when they can use other toys and objects for comfort. This pacifier helps prevent dental damage from pacifier over usage.

I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!!

That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material.

As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope!

The item itself seems terribly flimsy, and just has a cheap feel, much cheaper than I would expect from a product that's more expensive than a lot of competing products. Maybe it's composed of a tough, lightweight plastic, but if something looks cheap and feels cheap, well, let's just say it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in a product.<br /><br />The next concern is battery life, which is rather poor. I guess those UV rays must take a lot of juice, because a fresh set of batteries doesn't last very long. That leads in to wondering just how well this thing works, especially when the batteries start to die down a bit. It takes about 3 minutes to sterilize a pacifier, but there's no real way to know how well it's working. Also, the directions tell you to rinse off the pacifier prior to use, so that might limit just how useful it is when you're on-the-go.

The original maker of this design is The First Years, not Avent.  So when I saw this on the shelf, I was misled because Phillips Avent is making a pacifier which looks exactly like the green pacifier that First Years used to make.  This may not be a big deal to anyone else (or their baby), but my baby knew the difference & wanted nothing to do with the Avent brand paci.  When I compared the two, I noticed that the Avent brand paci was slightly harder than The First Years brand.  With The First Years, my baby could chomp down easier & get better suction too.  Our hospital gave out The First Years brand, and that is all my daughter will take now.  At 4 months old, this particular brand did not work for us, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you.  But if your baby is picky, I would stick to the original brand if you know that's what (s)he likes.<br /><br />Note: Though she always prefers her green First Years brand, now at 9 months, baby is accepting the Avent brand.<br /><br />UPDATE:  FIRST YEARS does not make this paci at all anymore.

I want to say that the green pacifiers have been great, and of all the ones on the market, this is the only one she will take... even if there was a small adjustment period when the new brand took over.  I think it's important to note that the 0-3 Months pacifiers are preferable to her because they are softer.  When I tried buying the paci for older babies, she spit it out & simply could not get good suction.  It seemed too hard & uncomfortable for her.  Anyway, at 18 months old, she was still using this green 0-3 month paci, and we will ween her off the paci soon.  Right now it's a great soother while she is teething, as nothing else works.

For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.

Even on a pacifier holder, they would fall onto his clothes or blanket & pick up dust and hair instantly. So to say I was excited about this product would be an understatement. Here is what I wish I had known before I purchased it:    The keep-it-kleen pacifiers DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE! They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son's mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.     Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I'm not sure this is very hygienic.    In summary, I guess that a pacifier that closes some of the times it is dropped is better than one that never closes (ie a regular pacifier), but for the price, and the fact that it doesn't work in both large and small drops, I would not recommend it.",2/11/2010,Not what I expected,R2U5IJEFRRQS77,Y,2,43,36,N

One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.

First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.
