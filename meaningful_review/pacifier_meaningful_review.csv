I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise/air swallowing/gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex.<br /><br />Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures).<br /><br />After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now.<br /><br />I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon. As you'll see in the photos, the hospital paci has a &#34;matte&#34; finish (which probably feels rougher, more like a human nipple) and the First Years is shiny and smooth.<br /><br />*photo (left to right) orange newborn GumDrop, green 3+ months First Years GumDrop, blue Nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding.

We use them in the NICU where I've worked, and they are perfect even from the very start.  This review is more about why the owl is the best of the Wubbanubs! We have this one and the giraffe, and I've encountered many others at work and that friends' kids have. This one always seems more sturdy and less floppy than the others. The soothie pacifier is not super light, and the giraffe's head and neck flops all over the place when I'm holding it. My baby is 5 months and she has a hard time getting that one back in her mouth when it falls out. The owl has a thicker neck and is sturdier overall. If the pacifier falls out, my baby can generally put it back in her mouth without having a huge meltdown (this is especially important when driving down the highway and trying not to crash). She also likes to grab his wings and feet. Some of the newer Wubbanubs come in bright/neon colors, but I like that this one looks like a normal animal. And, of course, owls are super in these days! ;) There are a lot of cute Wubbanubs out there, but in my opinion, this one is the best!  The only negative I would say (and this applies to all Wubbanubs and similarly styled pacifiers) is that you really shouldn't let your baby sleep with them!

I include an actual demo of its use in a dark room, stepping outside, and turning the lights off. It works exactly as advertised. The Foscam FBM2307 is NOT meant to be a high end, internet monitoring, SD card recording, remote controlled pan and tilt baby monitor. It has NONE of those features by design. There is no SD slot, there is no USB slot. By design. If you want those features, just look elsewhere. But as an excellent stand-alone baby monitor (or cat monitor, or front desk monitor) this works fine. I found the range to be outstanding - I left it in my office and made it about 200 feet away and down the stairs before the monitor lost contact with the camera (YMMV). Also, the clarity of the video and sound monitoring gave me nothing to complain about. This would be easy to throw in a bag or purse and take with you when you're travelling. It comes with two individual power supplies for the camera (which MUST be plugged in) and the monitor (which has a rechargeable battery and can be used remotely, but CAN be used plugged in). Overall it has a nice, solid feel. I confess to being a fan of budget products which work well. This is spot on in that category.<br /><br />Sample provided.",12/23/2014,46.42857142857143

I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.",8/15/2014,90.9090909090909

I don't think most people understand difference between these and something from 99 cent store. The fact is that babies feel comfortable when eating or breast feeding and using a pacifier replicates that warmth and comfort. They cant move on their own or use toys so this provides comfort and entertainment. but the bigger issue is sucking creates pressure that can damage structure of babies mouth causing crocked teeth or cross bites. So these are worth the money and that is why after a certain age you have to stop toddler from pacifier habit when they can use other toys and objects for comfort. This pacifier helps prevent dental damage from pacifier over usage. Also it states 0-6 month so after that find another pacifier size or other toys that they will enjoy. hope this is helpful if so please click the helpful link at the bottom.,8/9/2014,44.0

I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",1/11/2014,100.0

I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear.

I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do.

As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope! Amazon does seem to have the best price,  so I intend to purchase extras here",7/15/2013,48.214285714285715

 i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

(maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends.",11/17/2012,77.77777777777777

Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)",3/11/2011,89.56043956043955

He can hold on to the animal part when it's in his mouth and usually manuver it back in when it falls out.  He primarily uses it in the car and at daycare.  My one complaint is about cleaning it. I have been hand washing the pacifier part with dish soap and really hot water. The pacifier does not detach from the animal so I'm not sure how I'll clean that part when it gets really grimy.

As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.

They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son's mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.     Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I'm not sure this is very hygienic.

I have found it to be easy to clean and maintain (I oil it with extra virgin olive oil after washing it so that it looks like new). A little pricey but worth it for me.",12/22/2009,35.29411764705883

Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.

Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).

Plus, if the paci wears out, you can just buy a new $2 pacifier rather than a whole new toy!  That just makes more sense to me.

And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving.
